# Shopping-mall-management-system

ðŸ’¡Abstract:
 
The company has to keep up with the processing of large amounts of data. Data is used for things such as sales volume, sales, profits, shopping mall membership, storage of membership information and even for analysis of a particular product in the mall. As a result, a wide range of shopping malls have started to use intelligent management to enter the era of big data, however, the exponential growth of data is rapid and our data processing software must be constantly updated to meet the needs of data storage at this stage.
The shopping centre management system is based on such a database model, where shop information is stored in a database based on E-R relationship diagrams and mysql software, and users are free to rent one or more shops, and monthly rent and various fees are saved by adding the information once and automatically deducted at the end of the month. The database queries are then imported into Visual Studio 2013, written with Net Framework and winform console statements connected, and graphically implemented using the DataGridView control.
This standalone system requires a good knowledge of databases and the ability to write in C, C++ and C#, as well as the skills to use mysql, Visio and vs2013.
The software has a wide range of applications and can be a valuable management system in shopping malls. It also provides a solid foundation for a large scale online system for a global chain of shopping malls and is of wide research interest.

Keywords: E-R relationship diagram, winform, .NET FRAMEWORK library, DataGridView, Visio


ðŸ’¡The main functions required to be achieved by this system are as follows:

(1) Users can rent one or more shops and can top up their fees

(2) User and shop information is stored in a database

(3) The shop will be required to pay monthly rent, utilities, property charges, etc.

(4) Shops are automatically charged each month

   In addition to this, the following functions have been added to the system:
   
(1) Shop and user information can be queried, added, deleted and modified

(2) The shop has many details including location, lease status, rent, decoration, name, type of shop etc.

(3) You can edit the individual amounts of utilities, property charges and financial amounts

(4) You can keep a record of financial expenses and income

(5) User name and password are required to enter the interface, and the administrator has super privileges: he can modify the login information of ordinary users.

The specific flow chart of the requirement analysis is as follows:

ðŸ’¡Results display:

For the demonstration, as the administrator interface includes the functions of the user interface, the following demonstration is carried out in administrator mode, with the user name and password required for login.

The user information management screen also has the above functions. This shows the ability to add user information.

ðŸ’¡Outlook for follow-up workï¼š

After the completion of this experiment, I found that I still have many shortcomings:
     
1: The graphical interface is not beautiful enough.
     
2: The initialized interface cannot add management system text, many of them are added to the pictures and text by PS later.
     
3: top-up and payment, if there are more shops, you need to add information separately, and only next month you can automatically deduct the fee.
     
4: Some of the procedures are very complicated to write and could be more streamlined.
     
So in the next learning process, I will further consolidate the database related knowledge, while learning more kinds of graphical interface methods, MFC, QT is said to be a very good graphical interface software, I want to understand more deeply how they are used.
